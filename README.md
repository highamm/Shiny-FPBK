# Shiny-FPBK

Contains the code to run the Shiny app for the Finite Population Block Kriging estimator with the possibility of imperfect detection. Along with the actual Shiny app, a Vignette is provided to illustrate proper use of the application with a simulated data set. Though the app is designed for moose surveys with radiocollar data, it could be used for other finite population prediction problems where some sites are unobserved due to money, time, or accessibility constraints.
